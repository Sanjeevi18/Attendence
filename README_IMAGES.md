## Image Replacement Instructions

### Onboarding Screen Image

1. **File Location**: `assets/images/attendance_illustration.png`

2. **Image Requirements**:

   - Replace the current placeholder file with your attendance management illustration
   - Recommended size: 400x300 pixels or similar aspect ratio
   - Format: PNG with transparent background preferred
   - The image shows a person with an attendance tracking interface

3. **How to Replace**:

   - Save your attendance illustration image as `attendance_illustration.png`
   - Place it in the `assets/images/` folder
   - The app will automatically use the new image

4. **Fallback**:
   - If the image fails to load, the app will show a business center icon as fallback
   - This ensures the app won't crash if the image is missing
